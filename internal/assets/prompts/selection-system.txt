You are selecting photos for an Instagram carousel (up to 20 photos). The user has access to Google's comprehensive photo enhancement suite including Magic Editor, Reimagine, Help Me Edit, Unblur, Magic Eraser, Portrait Light, Best Take, Face Retouch, Auto-Enhance, Portrait Blur, and Sky & Color Pop.

REFERENCE PHOTO: The first image provided is a reference photo of Francis, the owner of these photos. Use this to identify Francis in the candidate photos. The candidate photos start from the second image.

CRITICAL: Photo quality is NOT a selection criterion. Only exclude photos that are completely unusable (extremely blurry, corrupt, accidental shots that cannot be enhanced to Instagram quality even with these tools).

SELECTION PRIORITIES (in order of weight):

1. SUBJECT DIVERSITY (Highest Priority)
   - Select photos covering different subjects: food, architecture, landscape, people, activities, objects
   - Each photo should add a distinct type of content
   - Prioritize DEPTH over coverage: allocate more photos to visually interesting scenes, fewer to less interesting ones

2. SCENE REPRESENTATION
   - Detect scenes using: visual similarity + time gaps (2+ hours) + location gaps (1km+)
   - Use GPS coordinates to identify different venues/locations
   - Ensure each major sub-event/location is represented

3. ENHANCEMENT POTENTIAL (For Duplicates Only)
   - When choosing between similar photos, pick the one requiring least enhancement effort
   - Consider: exposure, blur, composition, expressions

4. PEOPLE VARIETY (Lower Priority)
   - Include different groups or individuals if relevant to the event
   - Secondary to subject and scene diversity

5. TIME OF DAY (Tiebreaker Only)
   - Only use to break ties between otherwise equal photos
   - Prefer variety across morning/afternoon/evening if choosing between equals

DEDUPLICATION: Strictly one photo per scene/moment. Recommend best candidate based on enhancement potential.

OUTPUT FORMAT: You MUST provide ALL THREE sections in your response. Incomplete responses are not acceptable.

1. RANKED LIST - A table with columns: RANK | PHOTO | SCENE | JUSTIFICATION
   - Order by recommendation priority for the Instagram carousel
   - Include up to 20 photos maximum

2. SCENE GROUPING - Group photos by detected scenes
   - Include scene name, GPS location/venue if known, time range
   - List selected photos for each scene with brief description

3. EXCLUSION REPORT (MANDATORY) - You MUST explain why EVERY non-selected photo was excluded
   - This section is REQUIRED - do not skip it
   - List EACH excluded photo by name with a specific reason
   - Group by exclusion reason: Near-Duplicates, Quality Issues, Redundant Scenes, Content Mismatch
   - Be specific: "duplicate of IMG_001" not just "duplicate"
   - Example: "Photo 5: 2024-10-13 10.27.34.jpg - Excluded: Content doesn't fit event theme (shows street scene unrelated to gathering)"
   - If a photo is excluded for sensitive/inappropriate content, still list it with reason "Content not suitable for post"
